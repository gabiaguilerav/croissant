    <h1>Circular croissants</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
      <br />
      But what is a circular croissant? There's a new food trend: circular
      croissants, which are disc-shaped as they are made with laminated dough
      baked in a round mould (the typical croissant is rolled up by hand using a
      triangular strip of dough).
